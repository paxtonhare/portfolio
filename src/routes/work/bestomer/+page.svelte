        When I first interviewed with Bestomer I was turned down being told that they couldn't be sure I was a fit for the company. I told them that I was
        so confident that I could help them that I would work for free for a month. They initially declined this offer with concerns that
        it would take up too much of their valuable time to ramp me up.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        I then added that I would not only work for free for a month, but I would not ask for any help. I would figure everything out on my own. They accepted.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        I blew their minds by adding thorough unit tests to their backend api code in the first week. Intrigued, they then tasked me with creating a share extension
        for their React Native IOS app. I had never written a line of React Native before. I had the extension working in a week. They were impressed.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        I was promptly hired as employee 12.

      <h3 class="my-4 text-2xl tracking-tight font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white">Going Native</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">
        After hiring on I was tasked with creating a native IOS app. I created the app in SwiftUI. Shortly thereafter we hired a super experienced IOS developer who
        took over the IOS development. I then moved on to creating a native Android app in Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. This was my first Android app in Jetpack Compose.
        I was able to get the app to feature parity with the IOS app in a month.
      </p>
      <h3 class="my-4 text-2xl tracking-tight font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white">Pivot!</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Eventually we realized that we were building the wrong thing. We were building an app when our combined expertise was in
        scalable, secure, and reliable backend systems. We pivoted to building a backend focused system.

      <p class="mb-4">
        I shifted to working on our Typescript Nodejs backend. I also maintain a separate Python server for our machine learning models.
