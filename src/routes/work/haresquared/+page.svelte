        I created an <a href="https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/weinermoji-dachshund-emoji-stickers/id1186997786" class="underline">emoji app all about Dachshunds</a>. It was a simple app that allowed you to send Dachshund emojis to your friends. It was a top 10 app in the App Store for a few weeks.

      <p class="mb-4">
        After my success with Weinermoji I became obsessed with Marketing. This drove me to start a Facebook Ads Agency.
        I helped small, local businesses get more customers by running Facebook ads for them. I was able to get a 10x return on ad spend for my clients.
        At some point I had to decide between my agency and my job at MarkLogic. I chose MarkLogic.
